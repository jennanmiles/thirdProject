As a general walk through the code, my first funtion is validating if the user input a number in the correct range (8-128). On blur, it sends an alert to the user that their number is incorrect.

I then break the user input into strings based on selection types and create variables. If the user checks a box (is true) it loops through the string and finds a random character then concats it with the next true user input. We loop through that multiple times until we reach the user input's length.

We then change the value of the input area to match the randomly generated password. 

Then we copy that ish on click! 

I included all the code I tried below, more for my own reference than anyone else's. 

Thanks!
